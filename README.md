- 👋 Hi, I’m _Rodrigo Marín_, I also use **zenKmi** as a nickname online. I'll be graduating for Computer Science Engineering on June 2024, and I'm currently working with Willdom as a Full Stack Developer.
- 👀 I’m interested in music, videogames, and coding. I like to learn different languages whenever I can. So far I'm working with C++, C#, Java, and Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning whatever I can.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can teach me things I don't know yet, or even to get better at something I already do.
