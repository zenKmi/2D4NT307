- 👋 Hi, I’m _Rodrigo Marín_, I also use **zenKmi** for my online persona. I got my Systems Engineering degree in June 2024, and I'm currently working with Willdom as a Full Stack and AI Dev.
- 👀 I love playing videogames, music, and tech stuff. I'm always looking for the next big thing to learn about. Fluent in English and Spanish... so, "Hola!".
- 🌱 I’m open to learning anything that I don't know about. Currently I consider myself _good enough_ with JS, TS, C#, Java, but I'm also not too bad with Python.
- 💞️ I’m open for collaboration on anything that can teach me things I don't know yet, or even to get better at something I already do.
